# Whether the IPN listener should initiate a payment capture when it receives

# Overrides to this value should be deployed in coordination with the front-
# end integration. When the front-end is using the Checkout integration (i.e.
# $wgDonationInterfaceGatewayAdapters['adyen'] == 'AdyenCheckoutAdapter'),
# this value should be false. When the front-end is using the HPP integration
# ($wgDonationInterfaceGatewayAdapters['adyen'] == 'AdyenAdapter'), this

# integration, this setting can be deleted along with the code to send
